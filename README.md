-------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository provides an implementation of Recurrent Neural Network based on tutorial [http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-2-implementing-a-language-model-rnn-with-python-numpy-and-theano/](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-2-implementing-a-language-model-rnn-with-python-numpy-and-theano/).

The code has been written in the form of the package that can be used with `import` command.
